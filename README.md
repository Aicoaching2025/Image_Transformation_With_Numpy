# 🎨✨ **Image Transformation with NumPy and Linear Algebra** ✨🎨

Welcome to the **Image Transformation Project**! 🚀 In this project, we will explore how to **create** and **transform images** using the **power of NumPy arrays** and the fundamentals of **linear algebra**. You will learn how images can be represented as arrays and how matrix operations can manipulate them in exciting ways! 🖼️➡️🔢

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
In this project, we harness the power of **NumPy** and **linear algebra** to:

✅ Represent images as NumPy arrays 📊  
✅ Perform image transformations (rotate, scale, flip) 🔄  
✅ Visualize how matrix operations affect images 🎥  
✅ Learn the math behind image manipulation 🧮  

> **Why this project?**  
> Understanding how images work at the pixel level and how matrix operations can manipulate them is essential in fields like computer vision, graphics, and data science! 💻📷

## 🛠️ **Features**
✨ **Create images from scratch using NumPy arrays**  
🌀 **Transform images with matrix operations**  
📐 **Rotate, scale, and flip images easily**  
🎨 **Visualize changes instantly with Matplotlib**  
🧠 **Learn the connection between math and digital images**

## 📦 **Installation**

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

---

## 🧪 **Usage**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple black-and-white image (array)
image = np.zeros((100, 100))
image[25:75, 25:75] = 1  # White square in the middle

# Display the image
plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
plt.title("Original Image")
plt.show()

# Rotate the image using matrix operations
def rotate_image(image_array, angle_degrees):
    theta = np.radians(angle_degrees)
    rotation_matrix = np.array([
        [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],
        [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]
    ])
    # Transformation logic goes here
    return image_array  # Placeholder

rotated_image = rotate_image(image, 45)
plt.imshow(rotated_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title("Rotated Image")
plt.show()
```
